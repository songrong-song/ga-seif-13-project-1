This project is inspired by the popular mobile music rhythm game ‘CYTUSII’. The song I selected was LILAC FOR ANABEL from CYTUSII, a sweet song with strong beats. It aims to provide users with an engaging and relaxing gaming experience while allowing them to improve their tapping skills over time.

To begin, the user would select a song from the available options. Once the game starts and the song begins, cues will appear on the screen to guide the user on when to hit specific buttons or keys in time with the music. These cues may be represented by arrows, buttons, or other symbols that correspond to different parts of the song. The user will need to hit the cues in time with the beat of the music as the song progresses.

In this game, the user can earn points for accurately hitting the cues in time with the music. The user can continue playing the song until they reach the end, after which they will receive a score based on their performance. Upon completion, the user will be directed to the main page where they can choose to play the same song again or switch to a different song.

To differentiate this game from other online rhythm music games where the keys used are located close to each other (A,S,D,F), making it challenging for users to control, this game will feature only three keys (A, L, space). Hopefully This simple and intuitive control system will enhance the gaming experience.
